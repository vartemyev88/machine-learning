## â„¹ Age Estimation From the Photo

A network supermarket is implementing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may interest customers in this age group and to monitor the honesty of cashiers when selling alcohol. A model is being built that will determine the approximate age of a person based on a photograph. You have a set of photographs of people with their age specified. Data provided by Yandex.Practicum.
