## â„¹ Taxi Demand Prediction

The goal is to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour using historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak demand periods, it is necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour. A model is built for such a prediction, which involves time series analysis, regression, and forecasting techniques. Data provided by Yandex.Practicum.
